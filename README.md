# Undertale/Deltarune Wiki tweaks

This extension tweaks Undertale Wiki's and Deltarune Wiki's MediaWiki setup to our liking, to eliminate the need for patching MediaWiki core.

## Tweaks

- Adds custom messages for custom user groups we introduced on the wikis
- Moves all notifications that were in the 'notices' section into the 'alert' section, as [our skin](https://github.com/utdrwiki/skin) only displays that section
